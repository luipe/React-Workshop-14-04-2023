## Exercise 1 - Create Your Own React App

**Goal:** We set up our own React app, which we will use as a basis for a memory game that we will implement throughout this workshop.

### Steps
1. Got to `https://codesandbox.io` and log in.

2. Click on "Create"
   * Select "React Typescript"

3. Have a look at the generated files.
    * What files were created?
    * Try to change something and see the result.

4. Write your own "Hello World" component

4. For team collaboration in the upcoming exercises: Push your code to a common repo via
   ```shell
   git remote add origin ssh://git@bitbucket.int.tngtech.com:122/msd/react-workshop-2023-02.git
   git push -u origin HEAD:[branch-for-your-group]
    ```
